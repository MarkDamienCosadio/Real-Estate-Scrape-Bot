## Known Working Selectors
1. Price Filter:

   price_selectors = [
       '//*[@id="price"]/button',
       '//button[contains(@class, "price-button")]',
       '//button[contains(text(), "Price")]',
       '//button[contains(@aria-label, "Price")]'
   ]
   ```

2. Beds Filter:
   ```python
   beds_selectors = [
       '//*[@id="beds"]/button',
       '//button[contains(@class, "beds-button")]',
       '//button[contains(text(), "Beds")]',
       '//button[contains(@aria-label, "Beds")]'
   ]
   ```
